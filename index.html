They have been known to swim continuously for up to 10 hours at a time, thanks to their large, webbed paws that act like paddles.</div></div>

The black skin helps them absorb and retain heat from the sun.</div></div>
                        <div class="card"><img src="images/polar-cubs-eating.jpg" alt="2 polar bear cubs eating a seal" width="200"><div class="text"><span>Powerful Predators:</span> Polar bears are at the top of the Arctic food chain and primarily feed on seals. They have a highly developed sense of smell, allowing them to detect seals nearly a mile away and through several feet of compacted snow and ice.</div></div>

Female polar bears are smaller, typically weighing between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms).</div></div>
